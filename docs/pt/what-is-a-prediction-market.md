# What is a Prediction Market?

## Quick Answer

**A prediction market is a trading platform where people buy and sell contracts based on the outcomes of future events.** These markets harness the collective wisdom of crowds to create more accurate forecasts than traditional polling or expert predictions, while allowing participants to profit from their insights.

## Understanding Prediction Markets

### üéØ **Basic Concept**

#### **Market-Based Forecasting**
- **Trading Outcomes**: People trade contracts representing different event outcomes
- **Price Discovery**: Market prices reflect collective beliefs about probabilities
- **Financial Incentives**: Accurate predictions rewarded with profits
- **Crowd Wisdom**: Aggregate many individual opinions into market consensus
- **Real-time Updates**: Prices adjust instantly as new information emerges

#### **How Prices Work**
- **Probability Representation**: A token price of 0.65 USDT suggests 65% probability
- **Binary Outcomes**: Most markets have YES/NO outcomes
- **Price Range**: Prices typically range from 0.01 to 0.99 USDT
- **Settlement Value**: Winning tokens become worth 1.00 USDT, losing tokens worth 0
- **Continuous Trading**: Prices update constantly based on supply and demand

### üí° **Real-World Example**

#### **Presidential Election Market**
```
Event: "Will Candidate A win the 2024 Presidential Election?"

Current Market Prices:
- YES tokens: 0.45 USDT (45% implied probability)
- NO tokens: 0.55 USDT (55% implied probability)

Your Analysis:
- You believe Candidate A has a 60% chance to win
- YES tokens appear undervalued at 45%
- You buy 1,000 YES tokens for 450 USDT

Possible Outcomes:
- If Candidate A wins: 1,000 tokens √ó 1.00 = 1,000 USDT (550 USDT profit)
- If Candidate A loses: 1,000 tokens √ó 0.00 = 0 USDT (450 USDT loss)
```
