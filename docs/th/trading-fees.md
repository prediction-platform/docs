## Detailed Fee Examples

### Trading Fee Examples

#### Example 1: Buying YES Tokens
**Scenario**: Buy 1,000 YES tokens at 0.60 USDT each

**Calculation**:
- Trade Value: 1,000 × 0.60 = 600 USDT
- Platform Fee: 600 × 0.0015 = 0.90 USDT
- Gas Fee: ~0.01 USDT (estimated)
- **Total Cost**: 600 + 0.90 + 0.01 = 600.91 USDT

#### Example 2: Selling NO Tokens
**Scenario**: Sell 500 NO tokens at 0.75 USDT each

**Calculation**:
- Trade Value: 500 × 0.75 = 375 USDT
- Platform Fee: 375 × 0.0015 = 0.5625 USDT
- Gas Fee: ~0.01 USDT (estimated)
- **Net Proceeds**: 375 - 0.5625 - 0.01 = 374.4275 USDT

#### Example 3: Multiple Partial Fills
**Scenario**: Buy order for 2,000 tokens filled in 3 parts

**Fill 1**: 800 tokens at 0.55 USDT
- Trade Value: 800 × 0.55 = 440 USDT
- Platform Fee: 440 × 0.0015 = 0.66 USDT

**Fill 2**: 700 tokens at 0.56 USDT
- Trade Value: 700 × 0.56 = 392 USDT
- Platform Fee: 392 × 0.0015 = 0.588 USDT

**Fill 3**: 500 tokens at 0.57 USDT
- Trade Value: 500 × 0.57 = 285 USDT
- Platform Fee: 285 × 0.0015 = 0.4275 USDT

**Total**:
- Combined Trade Value: 1,117 USDT
- Combined Platform Fees: 1.6755 USDT
- Combined Gas Fees: ~0.03 USDT (3 transactions)
- **Total Cost**: 1,117 + 1.6755 + 0.03 = 1,118.7055 USDT

### Settlement Fee Examples

#### Winning Position Settlement
**Scenario**: Hold 1,000 YES tokens, event resolves to YES

**Settlement**:
- Token Value: 1,000 × 1.00 = 1,000 USDT (YES tokens worth 1 USDT each)
- Platform Fee: Already deducted during original trade
- Gas Fee: ~0.01 USDT (settlement transaction)
- **Net Settlement**: 1,000 - 0.01 = 999.99 USDT

#### Losing Position Settlement
**Scenario**: Hold 800 NO tokens, event resolves to YES

**Settlement**:
- Token Value: 800 × 0.00 = 0 USDT (NO tokens worth 0 USDT each)
