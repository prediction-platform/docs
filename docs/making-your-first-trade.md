# Making Your First Trade

## Overview

Congratulations on successfully depositing funds into your YC365 account! Now you're ready to make your first prediction market trade. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process, from understanding market mechanics to executing your first order successfully.

## Understanding Prediction Market Trading

### üéØ **Basic Concepts**

#### YES/NO Tokens
Every prediction market on YC365 creates two types of tokens:
- **YES Tokens**: Represent belief that the event will occur
- **NO Tokens**: Represent belief that the event will NOT occur
- **Token Prices**: Range from 0.01 to 0.99 USDT
- **Price Sum**: YES price + NO price ‚âà 1.00 USDT

#### Market Mechanics
- **Price Discovery**: Prices reflect collective market opinion
- **Probability**: Token price represents implied probability (e.g., 0.65 USDT = 65% chance)
- **Settlement**: Winning tokens become worth 1.00 USDT, losing tokens become worthless
- **Trading**: You can buy/sell tokens before event resolution

### üí° **Profit Mechanisms**

#### Method 1: Trading Before Resolution
- **Buy Low, Sell High**: Purchase tokens and sell at higher price
- **Market Timing**: Profit from price movements due to news and events
- **No Wait Required**: Realize profits immediately upon sale

#### Method 2: Hold Until Resolution
- **Binary Outcome**: Win 100% or lose 100% of your stake
- **Maximum Return**: Winning tokens always pay 1.00 USDT
- **Patience Required**: Must wait for event to conclude
