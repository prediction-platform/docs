# Markets

The Markets hub inside YC365 highlights live, upcoming, and popular prediction opportunities. It combines fast filters, rich market cards, and analytics widgets so you can discover trades in seconds.

## Browsing Live Markets

*The All Markets view lists featured events, real-time odds, and quick CTA buttons for YES/NO orders.*

- **Category chips** across the top (AI, Election, Sports, Movies, etc.) instantly filter the feed.
- **Search** in the upper-right narrows results by event title or keyword.
- **Market cards** expose implied probability, current volume, and direct buy buttons without leaving the directory.
- **Quick actions** (`Yes` / `No`) allow rapid order placement once your wallet is connected.

When using the Chrome Dev MCP tooling, you can verify each cardâ€™s data payload by inspecting the `livemarkets` GraphQL response directly from the Network tab.

## Leaderboard & Activity

YC365 also surfaces aggregated performance data to highlight top-performing wallets and market makers.

- **Volume leaderboard** exposes wallets contributing the most traded volume across markets.
- **Profit leaderboard** surfaces consistent winners and helps you benchmark your own strategy.
- **Timeframe toggles** (Day/Week/Month/All) reveal short-term momentum versus long-term consistency.
- **Chrome Dev MCP tip:** capture this panel during QA to ensure leaderboard API responses are cached and paginated correctly.
