# How to Earn Profits

## Overview

YC365 offers multiple pathways for users to generate profits from prediction market trading. Understanding these different profit mechanisms is essential for developing successful trading strategies and maximizing your returns on the platform.

## Two Primary Profit Sources

### 1. Market Trading (投注后在市场出售投注凭证)
Trade your prediction tokens (YES/NO tokens) on the secondary market before event resolution to capture price movements and market inefficiencies.

### 2. Event Settlement (等待最终结算)
Hold your tokens until event resolution to receive payouts based on the actual outcome of the predicted event.

### Market Trading Examples

#### Example 1: News-based Trading
**Scenario**: Sports prediction market for football championship

**Setup**:
- Event: "Team A will win the championship"
- Initial YES token price: 0.45 USDT
- Purchase: 1,000 YES tokens for 450 USDT

**News Impact**:
- Team A's star player returns from injury
- Market reacts positively to news
- YES token price rises to 0.65 USDT

**Profit Realization**:
- Sell 1,000 YES tokens at 0.65 USDT = 650 USDT
- Trading fees: 650 × 0.0015 = 0.975 USDT
- Gas fees: ~0.02 USDT
- **Net Profit**: 650 - 450 - 0.975 - 0.02 = 198.005 USDT
- **Return**: 44% profit in short time

#### Example 2: Volatility Trading
**Scenario**: Political prediction market

**Setup**:
- Event: "Candidate X will win election"
- YES token price range: 0.35 - 0.75 USDT
- Strategy: Buy low, sell high on volatility

**Trading Sequence**:
1. **Buy**: 500 YES tokens at 0.35 USDT = 175 USDT
2. **Sell**: 500 YES tokens at 0.70 USDT = 350 USDT
3. **Profit**: 350 - 175 - fees = ~174 USDT (99% return)

#### Example 3: Contrarian Trading
**Scenario**: Economic prediction market

**Setup**:
- Event: "GDP growth will exceed 3%"
- Market overreacts to negative news
- YES token price drops from 0.60 to 0.30 USDT

**Strategy**:
- Analyze fundamentals suggest price drop is excessive
- Buy 2,000 YES tokens at 0.30 USDT = 600 USDT
- Wait for market correction

- **Profit**: ~400 USDT (67% return)
