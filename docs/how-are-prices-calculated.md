# How Are Prices Calculated?

## Overview

YC365 employs a sophisticated pricing mechanism that combines Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology with real-time order book dynamics to ensure fair, efficient, and transparent price discovery across our global, multi-language prediction markets.

## YC365 Pricing Architecture

### üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture Foundation**

#### **Smart Contract Integration**:
- **LP Contract Set**: Manages independent liquidity pools for each condition's YES/NO tokens
- **Trading Contract Set**: Executes price-based buy/sell transactions
- **Order Trading Model**: Provides order book management and matching engine
- **Vault Contract Set**: Handles asset management and fee collection

#### **Multi-Component Price Discovery**:
- **Automated Market Maker**: Provides continuous liquidity and base pricing
- **Order Book System**: Enables limit order trading and price improvement
- **Real-time Settlement**: Instant price updates via smart contracts on BSC
- **Cross-Language Consistency**: Uniform pricing across all 6 supported languages

## Primary Pricing Mechanisms

### üìä **Current Implementation: Order Book Model**

#### **Market Price Calculation**:
Based on YC365's technical architecture, the current pricing model uses:

```
Market Price = Lowest Ask Price (Seller's Minimum Price)
```

#### **Price Discovery Process**:
1. **Limit Orders**: Users place buy/sell orders at specific prices
2. **Order Matching**: Matching engine processes orders by price-time priority
3. **Price Setting**: Current market price = lowest available sell order
4. **Real-time Updates**: Prices update instantly with each trade

#### **Example Pricing**:
```
Order Book State:
Sell Orders: 0.65, 0.67, 0.70 USDT (YES tokens)
Buy Orders: 0.60, 0.58, 0.55 USDT (YES tokens)

Current Market Price: 0.65 USDT (lowest sell order)
Bid-Ask Spread: 0.65 - 0.60 = 0.05 USDT
```

### üîÑ **Future Enhancement: Comprehensive Model**

#### **Advanced Price Calculation** (Planned):
```
Market Price = Weighted Average of:
- Transaction Prices (40%)
- Trading Volume (25%)
- Buyer Bid Prices (20%)
- Market Depth (15%)
```

#### **Enhanced Features**:

```
Slippage = |Expected Price - Actual Execution Price| / Expected Price √ó 100%
```

#### **Factors Affecting Price Impact**:
- **Order Size**: Larger orders create more price impact
- **Liquidity Depth**: Deeper order books reduce slippage
- **Market Volatility**: High volatility increases price unpredictability
- **Time of Trade**: Market hours vs. off-hours liquidity differences

#### **Impact Examples**:
```
Small Trade (100 USDT): 0.1-0.5% slippage
Medium Trade (1,000 USDT): 0.5-2% slippage
Large Trade (10,000 USDT): 2-5% slippage
```

#### **Fee Calculation Example**:
```
Trade: Buy 1,000 YES tokens at 0.60 USDT each
Trade Value: 1,000 √ó 0.60 = 600 USDT
Platform Fee: 600 √ó 0.0015 = 0.90 USDT
Gas Fee: ~0.01 USDT (BSC network fee)
Total Cost: 600 + 0.90 + 0.01 = 600.91 USDT
```
